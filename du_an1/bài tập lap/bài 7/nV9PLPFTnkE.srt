00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
In this series we're going to look around the most used parts of chrome

1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,830
developer tools, and ultimately this is going to be the very basics you need to

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,420
improve your development. And this is mainly for front-end development; but it

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,070
also comes into things like making Ajax calls, which is obviously on the front

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,600
end; but it also allows you to then inspect content you're getting through

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,460
on the backend. So generally we're going to go over the four things that you're

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,719
most likely to use within chrome developer tools. And the other thing to

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,620
know is that this is the same kind of concept for tools like firebug for

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,328
Firefox, so even if you're not using Chrome this should still be helpful.

9
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,820
So we're gonna kick things off with the element inspector the element explorer,

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,739
which basically allows you to look at all of the markup on your page, how it's

11
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,989
constructed, and also going to be looking at styles as well. So first of all let's just

12
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,369
take a look at what kind of files that were working with. So in my text editor, I

13
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,250
just have a document laid out here. I have a paragraph; we obviously have all

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,740
the basic tags that we would use; we have a title here; and I also have this style

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,789
sheet just here within this CSS directory. So i'm going to go ahead and

16
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,970
just link this style sheet in. So it's css/app.css I'm going to go

17
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,408
ahead and refresh the page. So that's changed the background color to gray

18
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,590
color. We also have a style attached to our paragraph here as well. And when you

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,270
are developing and you are changing styles around or changing markup around,

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,399
Sometimes it's easier to do this within Chrome, So change all of the styles that

21
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,509
you need to within Chrome, you can go ahead and copy and paste those styles

22
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,549
back over to your style sheet, or you can just edit elements on your page just to

23
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,899
see what happens.

24
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,780
So let's take a look at the very basics of bringing up your element explorer. Now,

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,699
the main way I do this is just a right click on the page and hit inspect

26
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,640
element. That's the quick way to do that. But you can also access it from the

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,130
menu just up here. So obviously right-clicking and hitting inspect

28
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,459
element is going to bring up your element tab just here. So this panel here

29
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,709
is going to show all of the elements on your page. So for example we can go to the

30
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,930
head, we can go to our meta tags title, and our linkedin reource is just here,

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,350
although these are a little bit less important to what we're going to be

32
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:44,829
doing here. So we can traverse through these, we can modify this content

33
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,220
as well, so let's just take a quick look at doing that and then we'll move over

34
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,560
to this area here where we can see all of our styles. So for example if I wanted

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,630
to change this text just herea I can double click it, and I can go ahead and

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:05,170
perhaps add an extra !, hit Enter and that will automatically be reflected in

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,079
the browser area just here.

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,980
So what we can also do is we can delete elements, I'm just going to hit the

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,959
backspace key that goes ahead and get rid of that element. If I refresh I'll see

40
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,070
that comes back because it's being served from the file. And what we can

41
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,780
also do is right click here and edit text which we've already seen. But we can

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,600
also do things like edit as HTML; So we could go here we wanted to, and add

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,630
additional element in. So we could have a span tag just in here and we can just

44
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,519
say hello in there. So we click away from this area that's automatically updated,

45
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,220
So it's added that markup in there for you.

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,760
So now that we've taken a look around this, we're going to move over to this

47
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,140
area here which you're most commonly going to use for styles. So for example the

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,450
paragraph tag has a style attached to it we can see that inside of the style sheet

49
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,170
just here. The body has a background color as well, but we're going to be

50
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,899
focusing on this paragraph element. So the paragraph element here. We can see

51
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,410
here, first of all, the user-agent styles, and these are the default styles applied

52
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,690
to this element by the browser. We also have the complete

53
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,469
muted styles as well and we'll talk about this surfing here in just a moment;

54
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,570
but you can see that we have a display of block on this element, we have an

55
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,120
automatic height, we have a margin, and we have a width to this as well. So these are

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,450
just what's being computed in terms of the styles.

57
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,380
Now this here shows the box model. If you're not familiar with the box model,

58
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,090
that's okay, I guess; I'll just explain or each of these represents as we go along.

59
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,760
This part in the middle is the width and the height of this element as it sits on

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,580
the page. If we go up one we see any padding on this. At the moment we don't

61
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,020
actually have any padding on this element. If we were to go ahead and add,

62
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:15,520
say, a padding left of 20 pixels, and we go ahead and refresh here you can see

63
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,030
that the padding now represents as a green item or green box just here, 20

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,960
pixel white box; and this is also updated here as well to show you the

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,280
sizing. This is really useful when you're working with positioning elements within

66
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,659
CSS you can see each of these, say, you move your mouse cursor over them. So the

67
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,500
border here we don't have a border but if we were to we would see that border

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,860
and would see the sizing on this as well.

69
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,599
Notice the positioning of this, we've got 20 pixels padding on the left.

70
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,120
If we were to add a right or top border we would see that here in place of these

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,720
hyphens. Now we do have margin on this paragraph; we have a margin top of 16

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,080
pixels. I've actually removed the bottom margin. So we see that as nothing down

73
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,479
here, but if we were to leave that as a default we would see that. So this is all

74
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,660
well and good but really this doesn't help us in everyday life.

75
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,930
What does help us is that if we want to add additional styles to this paragraph we

76
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,370
can actually do that from this area here. So we can see the styles here that have

77
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,290
been applied by app.CSS and what it also does is after the call on it, it gives

78
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,530
us the line number of these styles as well.

79
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,600
We can actually click this and it will take us through to our sources tab, which we're

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,710
not exclusively going to be looking at in this series, but it's useful to know that

81
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,780
it's here; it just contains the files that are basically being served from

82
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,429
this page. So we can actually see this file now we're automatically taken to

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,780
line five where these styles have been applied. So it will be on the selector

84
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,140
level. So going back over to our element explorer how do we add or modify styles

85
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:13,000
within this area. Well we can do this by either clicking the value of this

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,310
style and we can modify the value. So we can say what we want to 20 pixel

87
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,410
margin on the bottom, we click away from this, that then adds 20 pixels margin on

88
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,370
the bottom, and you can see that represented by the orange area on the

89
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,310
page just there. And we can even add new styles. So say we wanted to - just revert

90
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,600
this back to zero - and we wanted to do just a few more things on this paragraph.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,050
So let's say for some reason we want to, say, we want the width of 50-percent. Let's

92
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,230
say we want there to be a 1 pixel border and that be solid and black, we can do

93
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:58,180
that, and then we could go ahead and, say, well, let's give this a foreground color

94
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,270
of red. So just something really ugly.

95
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,750
We've now got all of our styles; we're not going to want to refresh the page

96
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,930
because what that will do is it will pull through the app called CSS

97
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,670
stylesheet and reapply the styles that we actually have. This is a really useful

98
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:18,700
way to develop within the browser. So you can actually see your changes live on

99
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,530
the page, and what you can then do is just go ahead and copy all of these, or

100
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,179
just the ones that you want, so copy them to the clipboard, I'm gonna go here and

101
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,289
I'm just going to paste them in. We can just align these up if we want to,

102
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,079
and there we go. So we've now got them styles in here. So everything has come

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,610
through as expected. We can go ahead and refresh and the same styles're obviously

104
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,870
applied because we've just copy them over to our style sheet. That's a really

105
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,600
useful way of developing.

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,470
What about this part just up here? Well, all this means is inline styles. So we

107
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,970
could, for example, go ahead and set the height of this to 100 pixels, that will

108
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,529
apply this on here but you can see that this added the style attribute in here.

109
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,000
So you won't often use this but it's useful to know that it's there just in

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,779
case.

111
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,329
So we're going to go ahead and look at these items just here; before that what

112
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:22,920
i'm going to go ahead and do is I'm going to get rid of this style here, i'm

113
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,860
going to remove this paragraph and create an anchor; and let's go ahead and

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,069
say click me. And we'll add a class in here as well just so we can see what we

115
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,969
do with classes. So i'm just going to give us a class of link you obviously

116
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,880
wouldn't do this but we'll just use it as an example. So I've got this class here

117
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,120
called link, I'm not going to add me styles to where we just have this Click me

118
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,290
just here. So I click on this you can see that we've got that selector

119
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,279
in here, we can just do exactly what we want with it. So you can change the color

120
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,959
to red if we want, all that kind of stuff, and we can just go ahead and copy and

121
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,729
paste these in. So it works exactly the same way with classes or IDs,

122
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,680
any selectors you already have set up really. What we're going to look at now is

123
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,300
this button just here.

124
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,439
This allows us to add a style in. So basically create a new style role. So if

125
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:30,000
for example you had in your CSS file no styles at all but you

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,889
have a class of link here, an easy way to just create a selector for this will be

127
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,170
to click on this here. It will automatically append the element

128
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,540
type as well, you don't really need this in there.

129
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,889
What you could then go ahead and do is , just say what I want to be color red,

130
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:52,410
you can go ahead and copy that, head over here, and just paste that in. So it's as

131
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,639
easy as that, just makes it a little bit easier; and you could of course just then

132
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,540
go ahead and get rid of the element there and just include the class if you

133
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,469
wanted to.

134
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,820
So pretty straightforward. Now the reason I've chosen a link here is because we

135
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,700
have this button just here, and this allows us to toggle different pseudo

136
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,570
selectors on our element. So for example if we were to... just get rid of this

137
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,260
return to our standard link... we know that when we clicked on link it will turner a

138
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,640
purple color by default usually in browsers. So for example if we were to

139
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,500
toggle the visited state you can see you might not be able to see this, but very

140
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,260
very slightly it's changing the color of that too from blue to purple. So we can

141
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,180
also toggle hover, which doesn't do anything in this case; we can toggle

142
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,699
active in this case it's going red.

143
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,170
So when I click this and hold my cursor in, you can see that that's going red;

144
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,760
that's an active state. And we also have a focus state as well, which by default

145
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,180
gives this blue border type thing around here. So this allows you to toggle

146
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,680
different states.

147
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,510
So for example what you could do is, over in your style sheet, you could say link.hover

148
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:21,150
Now when I hover over this i want the font weight to be bold; silly

149
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:28,050
example but just to demonstrate. So with your predefined CSS styles. So we've got

150
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:35,339
hover pseudo selected just here to go hover --- bold. So now when I toggle

151
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,400
hover, that toggles the styles within my stylesheet. So whatever you define

152
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,260
your style sheet, if you have overridden the default behavior here, is going to

153
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,540
toggle them; and you'll notice that that's being made visible as well. So if

154
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,530
Somewhere in your styles you have this and you want to go ahead and modify this,

155
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,930
you select the item here, click hover you go ahead and add styles to what

156
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,859
you want. So we can change the color to red if we wanted to, we could go ahead

157
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,450
and copy and paste any styles that we had added as part of that as we saw before,

158
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,240
go ahead and refresh and then we have exactly the same

159
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,610
a result here. So in terms of the element explorer, there is a lot more that you

160
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,020
can do within this, but generally when you are doing front-end development

161
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,180
You're going to use what I've showed you just now the most. These are the most

162
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,550
used areas of this area here, which is mainly markup and all of your markup

163
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,180
on your page, and this every here which relates to your styles.
